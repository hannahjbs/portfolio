			<p>
			What is the role of methane mitigation in avoiding excessive warming?
			</p>

			<p>
			Methane is a short-lived but powerful greenhouse gas. While there is agreement that
				long-lived carbon dioxide must be phased out immidiately,
				the timescale for methane phaseout is still under debate.

			We wonder if including climate feedbacks in this discussion could
				lead to more urgency. For example, could we prevent
				any climate feedback mechanisms from tipping into instability and releasing more GHGs, just by doubling down on
				our methane mitigation efforts this century? Since methane is a powerful short-term
				actor, perhaps phasing out methane rapidly could reduce warming not just through its own mechanism, 
				but by the reduced warming sparing us from some further climate feedbacks.

				We'll begin to investigate this by looking at one climate feedback: the permafrost. 
				The permafrost holds a very large store of carbon
				and will thaw as global temperature increases.
				It is not clear whether rapid methane phaseout could prevent enough warming to
				spare some permafrost (and subsequent emissions) to put us on a cooler path forwards.

			</p>

			<p>
				We created a reduced complexity model of relevant Earth systems
				to capture dynamics between methane emissions, permafrost thaw, and long term surface temperature
				changes.

			<p>
   			 Our model describes radiative forcing,
				ocean layer heat transfer, the carbon cycle,
				and permafrost decomposition. These are represented internally
				as inter-coupled differential equations.

				To make our temperature projections,
				we started with Representative Concentration Pathways (RCPs), which are
				climate change scenarios with different emissions pathways.
				We used RCP 2.6, 4.5 and 6.0.

				We modified the methane emissions for these RCPs to our own
				varying methane schemes (1%, 5%, and 10% annual reductions).
			</p>

			<p>
				First, we validated our model against historical records,
				and it recreates the  dynamics we are interested in:

			</div>

			<p>
				On the image right, our model predicts slightly higher CO2 concentrations
				because as atmospheric carbon increases, plants actually uptake more carbon.
				We used a fixed coefficient for this, but realistically it is variable (to a point)
				and has increased. However, the model is sufficient to describe the
				relationships we are interested in qualitatively.
			</p>

			<p>
				Our model is implemented in python with object-oriented programming,
				which gives us flexibility to run many different scenarios.
				We use scipy’s solve_ivp to solve
				our coupled differential equations at any given timestep to produce
				to continuous projections.

			<p>
				Rapid methane mitigation did not prevent or delay permafrost feedback, and therefore, did not result in a long term
				temperature reduction. Below shows the linear relationship between the <u>magnitude</u> of
				methane emissions to temperature, and the negligible impact of <u>rate</u> of reductions.

			<p>
				We learned that final emissions baseline (i.e., at year 2100, how much methane was being emitted)
				was the most important factor
				in determining long-term temperature change.
				The annual rate of reductions
				did not have much impact, so long as the rate of phaseout was fast enough to
				ensure we reached our desired target.
				However, further research is needed with more consideration of other methane dynamics.
