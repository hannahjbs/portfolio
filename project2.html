				<h2>Shape Constrained Inference in Toxicology </h2>
			</header>

			<p><u><strong>Background</strong></u></p>
		<p class="indented">
             Chemicals must be screened for potential impact to human health,
			and the National Toxicology Program
			uses <a href="https://ntp.niehs.nih.gov/whatwestudy/tox21">
			quantitative high-throughput screening (qHTS) </a>
			to test thousands of chemicals at once. Each chemical is tested at 15 increasing doses
			multiple times. Responses (e.g., the amount of cell death,
			hormone agonism, or other depending
			on the dataset)
			for each dose are recorded.
			These doses and their related responses form "dose-response curves" (DRCs).

			Then, statistical analysis can screen out potentially hazardous chemicals
			for further testing.


			Most of the data looks like this, a classic sigmoidal dose-response curve:

				<a href="#" class="image featured">
					<img src="images/SHARP/monotonic_curve.png" alt="" class="resized-image" />
				</a>
			</div>

			<p>
				These sigmoidal DRCs are well characterized with a four parameter logistic equation, the "hill equation".
				This equation's parameters are useful in screening out potentially dangerous chemicals.
				One important parameter is EC50 (half maximal effective concentration), which is the inflection point
				of the sigmoid curve.

				However, some chemicals are non-sigmoidal:
			</p>

			<div class="centered-image">
				<a href="#" class="image featured">
					<img src="images/SHARP/non-monotonic.png" alt="" class="resized-image" />
				</a>
			</div>

			<p>
				For these non-sigmoidal curves, the hill equation may not fit well and could give potentially
				misleading estimates of EC50. Therefore, we needed a method that could filter out
				non-sigmoidal curves from the dataset of thousands of chemicals for further examination.
				We wanted to find out how many chemicals in the dataset were non-sigmoidal, what their hill
				parameters were estimated as, and if there were any patterns to what kinds of
				chemicals these were.
			</p>

			<p><u><strong>Methods</strong></u></p>

			<p>
             I modified a
				  <a href="https://github.com/qy2166/SRMERS">semi-parametric spline based statistical method</a>
				  for use with qHTS datasets. This is a shape-flexible approach to model
				non-linear data, and fits curves to 4 different shape "kernels"
				(“convex”, “concave”, “increasing” and “decreasing”). This gives us
				a way to sort out curves by shape.

			Confidence intervals for deciding shape were bootstrapped,
			which was computationally intensive. Therefore, I implemented adaptive
			bootstrapping to speed up processing time which improved speed by 25%.
          </p>


          <p>
             I used this method to sort a <a href="https://www.nature.com/articles/srep05664">
			  ~10,000 chemical dataset </a> by shape. I compared model fit to the traditional
			  logistic regression approach by
			  sums of squared error (SSE).
		  </p>


			<p><u><strong>Results</strong></u></p>

          <p>
             The dataset contained many different shapes, 8% of which were not sigmoidal. Logistic regression performed poorly for these shapes.
          </p>

				</a>
			</div>

			<p>
				As this was an estrogen receptor dataset, the chemicals with increasing responses
				were heavily associated with Estrogen Receptor 1 (ESR1).
				Less expectedly, some “concave” chemicals were also associated with ESR1.

			</div>

          <p>
			  Filtering qHTS datasets by shape first may be a good addition
			  to statistical workflows, allowing logistic regression to be
			  used on the most appropriate data.

			  Further research should be done on scientific relevance
			  of these non-sigmoidal datasets. Are they are a result of
			  experimental error or biology?

          </p>
